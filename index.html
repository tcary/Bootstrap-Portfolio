                            I'm so excited about my new career path and the ability to pursue my passion for helping
                            people
                            in a
                            new
                            way! In the past I have tried different ways to make a living, but nothing has satisfied my
                            hunger
                            for
                            "bigger and better me" completely. I always felt like something was missing, always thirsty
                            for
                            more...! Then a good friend of mine kept telling me about web-development and how much he
                            enjoys it. I
                            was
                            curious,
                            but so <strong>far</strong> away from being "techy".

                            scared to make that leap into the unknown, it's like falling out of the airplane without a
                            parachute
                            or
                            driving in the car at 120mph down a steep mountain road. Well you can only imagine what it's
                            like!
